# To-do

- [ ] Rewrite everything, starting from sane specs
- [ ] Syntax for precedence and symbolic operators
- [x] Add while loops
- [x] Make anonymous functions usable
- [x] Update BNF
- [x] Make scope work
- [x] Fix bug in variable resolution - see `euler_002.sin`
- [x] Add closures (sort-of)
- [x] Syntax for objects
      I probably messed up something
- [ ] How-to `self` keyword
- [x] Fix scope
- [ ] Fix tokenizing (namely, identifiers like `function` breaking the parser)
- [ ] Add None, True, False
