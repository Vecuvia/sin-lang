# To-do

- [ ] Syntax for precedence and symbolic operators
- [x] Add while loops
- [x] Make anonymous functions usable
- [x] Update BNF
- [ ] Rewrite everything, starting from sane specs
- [x] Make closures work
      Are these actually closures? I think I used the wrong word here.
- [x] Fix bug in variable resolution - see `euler_002.sin`
